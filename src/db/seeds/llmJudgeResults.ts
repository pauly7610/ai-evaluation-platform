While it correctly identifies structured vs. unstructured nature, it misses important aspects like ACID properties, scalability differences, use cases, and specific examples. The explanation is accurate but superficial and would benefit from more comprehensive coverage of transaction handling, consistency models, and when to use each type.',

In machine learning, instead of writing explicit rules, we feed data to algorithms that learn patterns and make predictions. The system improves its performance through experience without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Traditional programming is deterministic, while ML is probabilistic and adapts based on training data.',

The response clearly articulates the rule-based nature of traditional programming versus the pattern-learning approach of ML. It effectively highlights the deterministic vs. probabilistic nature and mentions adaptability. The answer could be strengthened by including specific examples or discussing limitations of each approach.',

While it captures the core concept of packaging and consistency, it lacks important details about isolation, resource efficiency, portability benefits, and comparison with virtual machines. The answer would significantly benefit from discussing specific advantages like faster deployment, microservices architecture support, and DevOps workflow improvements.

It is important for several reasons: 1) Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks by limiting excessive requests, 2) Ensures fair resource allocation among users, 3) Protects backend infrastructure from being overwhelmed, 4) Helps maintain quality of service for all users, and 5) Can be used as part of a monetization strategy with different tiers.
