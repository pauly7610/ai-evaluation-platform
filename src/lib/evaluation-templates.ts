Calibration Data: {calibration_data}
Expected Calibration Error (ECE): {ece}
Maximum Calibration Error (MCE): {mce}
Brier Score: {brier_score}

Calibration Quality Assessment:

1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE): {ece}
   - Perfect calibration = 0.0
   - Good calibration < 0.1
   - Acceptable calibration < 0.15
   - Poor calibration > 0.15

2. Maximum Calibration Error (MCE): {mce}
   - Maximum deviation in any confidence bin
   - Good < 0.15, Acceptable < 0.25, Poor > 0.25

3. Brier Score: {brier_score}
   - Lower is better (0 = perfect)
   - Good < 0.15, Acceptable < 0.25

4. Confidence-Accuracy Alignment
   - When model says 80% confident, is it 80% accurate?
   - Check each calibration bin for alignment

Calibration Patterns:
- Overconfident: Model's confidence > actual accuracy
- Underconfident: Model's confidence < actual accuracy
- Well-calibrated: Confidence matches accuracy closely
